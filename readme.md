# High-Performance Hardware for  Machine Learning/AI
## Jalasoft/Share The knowledge  - Gary Ascuy

In the last years we heard many about Machine Learning and AI, and how they can help with some repetitive tasks, and more recently in more complex tasks, but process those models requires a lot of computing power, and how it can be managed if you want to process thousand of thousand data, in some point conventional CPU it is not enough. And here is the question, how can we address this kind of problems? there are alternatives like graphics cards that can provide you the process power that you need. but those cards are created with the specific purpose to help in rendering side and it can be used for other purposes too. In other side Tensor Processing Unit is other kind hardware. It is an ASIC developed specifically machine learning. The world is changing and special hardware (with specific characteristics for some tasks) for intensive computing tasks is coming to reduce time & costs.â€‹
